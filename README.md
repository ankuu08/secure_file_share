# Secure File Sharing System ‚Äì Django Backend

A secure file-sharing backend system built using Django and SQLite, with support for:

- Two user roles: **Ops** (admin uploaders) and **Clients** (verified downloaders)
- JWT-based authentication and email verification
- Secure file uploads and token-based downloads
- Complete API coverage with Postman Collection

##  Postman Collection

You can import the Postman Collection:  
https://github.com/CSEExplorer/secure_file_share/blob/master/postman/Secure%20File%20Sharing%20API%20Collection.postman_collection.json

### Features

- Token extraction & reuse (JWT, email verification, download tokens)
- Pre-request scripts to set headers and tokens
- Full request chaining from signup to download

---

##  Security Highlights

- Role-based access control (Ops and Clients)
- JWT authentication
- One-time encrypted download links
- File validation based on extension
- Email verification before login

---

##  Notes

- JWTs should be passed in headers:
```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
```

- Email verification tokens are printed in the console for development.
- Download tokens expire immediately after first use.
- The backend returns proper error codes for failed auth or invalid links.

---

##  Deployment Plan

- Use Docker with `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
- Gunicorn as WSGI app server
- Nginx reverse proxy (optional)
- SSL setup with Let's Encrypt (Certbot)
- Use PostgreSQL in production (SQLite for local dev)
- Email service: SMTP or SendGrid for real verification
